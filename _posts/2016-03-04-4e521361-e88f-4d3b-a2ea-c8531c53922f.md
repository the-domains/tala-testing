Sound Therapy

We are comprised of vibrations. When we become ill either physically, emotionally and/or mentally, our vibrations become disrupted and we are no longer vibrating at our natural frequency. Sound Therapy is a non invasive and holistic approach used to alter ones vibration to help aid in healing.

Each treatment begins with a consultation followed by a tailored Sound Treatment. SOUND VIBRATIONS are used to help rebalance your body to your natural frequency with the use of musical instruments, tuning forks, the human voice & energy.

∗_The healing process begins and ends with you, I simply help guide you through it.∗_

Sound Therapy is a great alternative medicine for the following:

* _Stress_
* _Anxiety_
* _Addictions_
* _Prevention_
* _Trouble __Sleeping_
* _Deep Relaxation_
* _Physical Discomfort_
* _Emotional blockages_
